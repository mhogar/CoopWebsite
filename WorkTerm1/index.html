                My job at Camis consisted mostly of fixing bugs in the older blue and silver Everest software, and in the reservation website. My job also consisted of a large amount of configuration for the confirmation letters and business rules for the various parks, especially during the month of July, where we worked hard for Packs Canada’s upcoming release, where a lot of new campgrounds were added to the software. Most of the fixes took place in the code, written primarily in C#, but I occasionally had to dive into the database at fix SQL related issues, and even writing a stored procedure form scratch towards the end.
              </p>
              <p>
                I feel that not a lot of prior skills were required for my job, and most of the skills would be learnt on the job. Saying that, the co-workers I worked with were very helpful and I was able to learn the software relatively quickly. I was very impressed and pleased with what I was able to accomplish while on my work term.

                One of my favourite projects was when I integrated PureCloud into the software. PureCloud is a software service mad made by “” that Camis uses to manage call centre calls and record them. My job was to implement the API into Everest Silver to pause and resume recording during credit car inputs. This was a lengthy project, but I really enjoyed creating a whole new feature from start to finish. Sadly my coop term ended before I could see the result of the project in use (for better or for worse), but I am still very happy with the finished project.
